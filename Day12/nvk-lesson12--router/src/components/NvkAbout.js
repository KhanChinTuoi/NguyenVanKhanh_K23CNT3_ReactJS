            Congregation is a 2.1 solo Extreme Demon level created and published by Presta and verified by Floofle on 27 April 2021.[1] The level contains music sync-based gameplay and difficult timings. The level is one of the more controversial levels on the Demonlist, on which it reached a peak of #35, receiving praise from players for its atmosphere and music but criticism for its unconventional style of gameplay and its lengthy pre-drop section.[2][3]

            Congregation inspired the 'Congregation Jumpscare' meme, centred on videos in which gameplay of random unrelated levels is edited to lead into the drop section of Congregation unexpectedly.
